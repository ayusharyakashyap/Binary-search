**Binary Search Algorithm in Python**

This repository contains a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in Python. The script allows users to input an array and a target element, then performs a binary search to find the target within the array. It supports various data types including integers, characters, and strings.

Features:

- Dynamic Input Handling: Users can input arrays with elements of different data types (integers, characters, strings).
- Type Conversion: The script attempts to convert array elements and the target element to integers if possible.
- Binary Search Algorithm: Efficiently searches for the target element within the array.
- User-Friendly Output: Provides clear output messages indicating whether the target element was found and its index within the array.
